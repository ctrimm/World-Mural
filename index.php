          <p>Inspiration murals showcase the remarkable people in local communities and intricately exemplify their complex stories. These murals educate future generations and amplify the impact and memory of world-changing people who exist in small towns all over the world. Widely-acclaimed Inspiration murals exist today in State College, Pennsylvania and Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Through the World Mural project, we will work to bring communities together through the power of public art by creating Inspiration murals around the world.</p>

		          <p>From its conception to the never ending completion, this project is truly amazing. Watching the faces of the students as they listened to Michael and studied the murals was impressive. The students were awed and sometimes speechless. I hope they all have the chance to return and bring others to this wonderful sight.</p>

		          <p>One of the stops on a bus trip with some friends was the Williamsport Mural. Mr. Pilato told us the background of many of the people represented in the mural. The experience touched my soul. His talent combined with his passion reaches out and changes you a little. I will remember that feeling always. Thank you.</p>

		          <p>We had the immense pleasure of viewing the mural and having Michal personally give us a guided tour of his work. It is notable not only for the immense scope, but even more so for the ability of Mike to connect the people and their stories into the fabric of the work. Fantastic.</p>
